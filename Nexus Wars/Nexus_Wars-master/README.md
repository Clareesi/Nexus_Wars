# Nexus_Wars
Programmed a game using Python in which two players each had a nexus with a certain amount of health, and the ﬁrst player to destroy the other’s nexus wins. Each player could spawn soldiers to attack enemy structures. Diﬀerent categories of soldiers had diﬀerent attack power, health, and speed. Cannons could be placed in selected areas of the map to allow for more defense strategies.
